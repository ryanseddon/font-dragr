      h1 What is it?
      p font dragr allows you to easily test custom fonts, through the <code>@font-face</code> at-rule, without the need for any CSS coding or knowledge of CSS coding. All you need to do is drag and drop.
      p It alleviates the cumbersome nature of testing custom fonts and allows you to quickly and easily load in a font, play around with it and see if it's the right one for you.

      h1 How do I use it?
      p It's incredibly easy to use. All you need to do is drag and drop a font file from your computer into font dragr in a supporting browser (Such as Firefox 3.6+ or Chrome 6+).
      p You can also select a font to test from the gallery. These fonts can be tested in most browsers, including IE6 and up.

      h1 You can test on any website
      p Testing fonts within font dragr, while useful, won't give the full look and feel of testing it on your own site. That's where the font dragr bookmarklet comes in handy.
      p The bookmarklet allows you to test any font from your file system or any of the fonts found in the gallery. Same simple approach the web app has, with the added ability for testing on any website.
      p To install the bookmarklet in your browser just drag and drop the button below to your bookmarks. If you're not sure where to drag it too or you want to get a quick inside look at how you can use it make sure to check out the bookmarklet screencast.
